# Expeditus
Scheduling software based on nostr

# What is this?

This software helps you schedule shifts for upcoming events. For example, imagine you are organizing a booth at a local fair. You need to ensure someone from your group is there at every hour, so you break up the day into 3 hour "shifts" and then assign one or two to each shift. This software helps you automate some parts of that.

# Why did you make this?

Because sometimes I oragnize events and software like this is helpful with that. Also because when I searched online for free software for doing this stuff, everything I saw either required a paid subscription or it required you to create an account and give up your email or other info. Also because I thought it would be fun to make something like this using nostr as the place to store the data.
